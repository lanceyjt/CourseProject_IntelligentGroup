# CS410Project Intelligent Browsing via IntelligentGroup

To run this file independently please download or fork repo and use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that can run both JavaScript and Python as we recommend you use visual studio. 
In order to run this file via IDE you must have node 19.2.0 version installed as well as python 3.11.0 which will automatically get downloaded with the node version and you can get the latest node version via this link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/ 
Once you have all the proper pre-requisites, you can run this code with the command: node CS410.js within the IDE.
This will run the JavaScript Code which will call the python scripts within the src file. It will be using a test text file called log.txt to and should output every document URL, Word Frequency and Topics for each document. This will ultimately help users fine the key words that would be helpful for there search query so the user can optimize what they are searching for and get ultimately the best results/documents that suites their needs.


To run this via a chrome extension, please download our code from the GitHub repo. 
After you have successfully download your code on your local machine, please go to extensions in google chrome and flip the developer mode toggle in the top right corner. Once this is flipped on, then there should be an option now available in the top left corner: “Load Unpacked”. Select that option and import the file as a whole to the chrome extension and insert a query into the search bar. Once a query had been searched, the extension will then return the document URLs with the word frequency and topics used for each URL. Using this information will allow the user to see what topics are most relevant and can use those topics to benefit which documents are most useful for the user or whether the query will need to be optimized to help find the documents the user is looking for.
